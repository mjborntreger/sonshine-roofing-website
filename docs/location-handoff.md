# SonShine location migration handoff

## Current scope and authorization

The owner confirmed on 2026-09-15 that location reviews are a static import,
deduplicated and linked to each location, then maintained by hand. All n8n changes
and workflow-cutover requirements are withdrawn. The existing review workflow
remains active and unchanged. Directus migration and the 72 actual five-star reviews
are approved. On 2026-09-16 the owner also authorized the export/CI repair,
overviews, two-pass neighborhood descriptions, project neighborhood research and
local FAQs. On September 17 the owner confirmed the Saddlebag Creek Ranches and
Oak Hollow project memberships and requested removal of Arroyo Vista. These
[decisions are applied](location-decisions-20260917.md). The owner then approved all
25 researched additions and instructed execution of the integrated merge/release
plan. Those additions and their 28 project connections are now applied;
see [release execution](location-release-20260917.md).

Application rollback baseline (before this integrated release):
`0271ec70f46a2b31c4eb012da28459f6a9144184`.
This manual-review amendment starts from local `6957d2d31846ca392c07062d35c82f8a335975d1`.
September 15 frozen implementation: `4a4c5f6a7aed9dccd383c6de2c1be4c8fdbf6ba2`.
The current candidate includes subsequent export, CI and FAQ changes. The reviewed September 16 completion commit and build digests are recorded in
private `execution-2026-09-16/verification/completion-manifest.json`.

| State | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | Common location hubs, deterministic local/nearby selection, deployment snapshots, navigation/FAQ/SEO/sitemaps, model/privacy and repeatable migration/enrichment. Manual review isolation replaces the abandoned workflow work. |
| Migrated | Five canonical page owners, 87 original unique neighborhoods, 91 immutable files, one added taxonomy-only area and 39 junctions. All 53 project/job/ZIP enrichments and the SonShine-only required constraint are applied. |
| Published in CMS | All five location page owners are published with overviews and the existing SEO/date sets. There are 113 published neighborhoods, including the 25 approved release additions; Arroyo Vista remains archived. The 72 manual location reviews remain published. Added 25 local FAQs; the prior 45 FAQs are unchanged. |
| Deployment | PR #29 released `4967397` on September 17; Coolify reports healthy and public acceptance passed. Directus now owns the five hubs. `0271ec7` remains the retained rollback baseline. See the dated execution record. |
| Verified | September 15 import/readback and release-candidate checks remain historical evidence. September 16 export/CI/FAQ changes pass Node 22 lint, typecheck, Tailwind, all nine location verifiers plus export tests, and 14 dynamic-route contract groups. The integrated build generates 456 pages, validates 443 route owners, and serves all five hubs with 13 matching visible/schema FAQs. |
| Completion | All 25 additions and 28 project connections are applied. Eleven project relations retain documented empty exceptions. Final-head and main-push Quality/CodeQL, rebuilt snapshots, independent review and public desktop/mobile acceptance passed. Source branches and private recovery remain retained. |

## September 16–17 content and code update

- All five overview fields are populated. Page identities, introductions, SEO and
  publication states are preserved.
- Five published local FAQs per location precede all eight shared FAQs, giving
  13 answers per hub. The shared FAQ component preserves that order on mobile and
  desktop. The archive schema covers the same answers as its visible list.
- Neighborhood description pass one populated all 87 original canonical rows
  from WordPress. Pass two rewrote 86 descriptions with exact readback. Arroyo
  Vista's description was cleared and the record was archived on September 17.
  Its source identity and photo remain retained; no projects required unlinking.
- Saved 42 project assignments: the prior 14 plus 28 connections to the 25 approved
  release additions; 11 retain documented empty exceptions. See [all 53 dispositions](location-project-neighborhoods.md).
  Project-to-job mappings and primary service areas remain unchanged.
- Anonymous WordPress RAW bodies were null despite available rendered HTML. The
  exporter now captures `wordpress-location-source-v2`, labels rendered HTML and
  rejects missing bodies. A new private export contains all five page bodies;
  earlier captures remain immutable historical evidence.
- Quality CI runs `verify:locations` and `verify:dynamic-routes`. The latter covers
  all six parameterized public page families, their sitemaps and the resource API.
  Route-owner validation paginates completely. Special-offer static paths and
  sitemap entries now use the same complete published inventory.

## Reconciliation

- Five source pages retain all five public routes.
- The original 88 neighborhood occurrences resolve to 87 canonical records, with one duplicate
  Longboat Key presentation folded into Sarasota. University Park and Arroyo Vista
  preserve their raw WordPress source identities and existing Sarasota organization;
  Arroyo Vista is now archived. Two owner-confirmed additions and 25 approved
  release additions bring the inventory to 114 records, of which 113 are published.
- 93 media references resolve to 91 new immutable files, one shared-byte reuse and
  one excluded duplicate-owner image. WordPress originals remain intact.
- P1 Newtown/Washington Park is retained. P2 Waterford/Sawgrass is valid for both.
  These are explicit owner dispositions; exact photo geography is not an independent
  research claim. Image descriptions describe what is visible.
- 72 review occurrences are approved, including actual five-star ratings. Source
  allocation: Sarasota 15, Bradenton 13, Lakewood Ranch 4, Venice 21, North Port 19.
  Keep 71 verified dates, one null date, all 72 owner replies and source provenance.
  Two scheme-less links were verified with HTTPS prefixes without changing source keys.
- Fresh pre-import review comparison found no URL, normalized author/text or
  attribution-only candidate among the existing 32 SonShine records, and no duplicate
  source URL/text pair. Independent review found no plausible existing matches. Two pairs with generic
  overlapping praise have distinct attribution, source links and dates and remain
  distinct. All 72 were imported and published, with no Google identities created.
- Post-import total is 104 SonShine reviews: 72 manual plus 32 unchanged managed;
  92 published and 12 archived. A fresh verified-target replan returns zero
  operations and 72 review matches.

The planner's 53 generic job-enrichment-held entries are superseded by the completed
separate enrichment pipeline. Project-to-neighborhood verification is a separate
September 16 task. See [enrichment](location-enrichment.md).

workflow patches and seed plans are withdrawn historical evidence and must not run.

Retained prior application: `prior-application-0271ec7.docker.tar.gz`, image digest

Readability was verified; recovery has not been executed.
