              Undoubtedly, lack of maintenance is among the top reasons why roofs fail.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Whether it’s a large hole or a small leak, water that seeps below the top
              layer of a roof can destroy everything in its path. Small leaks, in particular,
              are dangerous because the damage often goes undetected for years. This hidden
              moisture leads to rotting wood sheathing and trusses, increased utility costs,
              and serious health risks due to mold and mildew growth. In fact, such damage can
              silently erode your safety, comfort, and security—sometimes for as long as 13 years
              before it becomes visible inside the home.

              While it may be tempting to ignore your roof’s maintenance needs, doing so can shorten
              its lifespan and lead to major expenses down the road. Roofing materials are built to
              last, but only when they’re properly maintained. That’s why SonShine Roofing strongly
              recommends following a roof maintenance schedule and sticking with it year after year.
              <br></br><br></br>
              Routine roof inspections are critical to catching these hidden problems early—before
              they escalate into major roof repairs, structural rot, or indoor health hazards that
              threaten your home and well-being.
