                  There are many roofing material options available to choose from,
                  and we’re here to help you determine what’s best for your home. As
                  with any roof replacement or home improvement project, material selection
                  plays a key role in the lifespan and performance of your roof.
                  <br /><br />
                  Elements like the type of nails used, quality of the underlayment, and
                  balanced, efficient attic ventilation all contribute to a successful
                  roof system. At SonShine Roofing, we take the time to walk you through
                  every material option and answer your questions thoroughly.

                  There are usually two types of warranty that come with your new roof: workmanship and manufacturer.
                  <br /><br />
                </p>

                <h4>Workmanship Warranty</h4>
                {/* Inline callout (#6) */}
              <div className="my-4 rounded-3xl border border-[#fb9216]/30 bg-[#fb9216]/5 p-4" role="note" aria-label="Important">

                  className="uppercase block font-display text-[1rem] text-slate-800 mb-1"

                    Fact:
                </strong>
                <p className="m-0 text-slate-700">
                  The vast majority of roof failures are caused by poor workmanship, and
                  often you won’t notice these errors for many years down the line without yearly
                  inspections.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                This is why it is important to seek out roofers who stand behind their work
                with extended workmanship warranties and have a long-standing reputation.
                This ensures that you won’t be on the hook for costly repairs that are not
                your fault.
                <br /><br />
                Depending on your roof and warranty package, you can enjoy up to 30 years of
                workmanship coverage with SonShine Roofing.
                <br /><br />
              </p>

              <h4>Manufacturer Warranty</h4>
              <p>
                Many roofing materials also come with warranties directly from the manufacturer
                that protect against product defects. That being said, such defects are incredibly
                rare with reputable vendors such as GAF, Eagle Tile, Westlake Royal Roofing,
                Polyglass USA, Crown Tile, and Sunshine Metal Supply.
                <br /><br />
                These warranties typically last for decades, some even up to 50 years on more
                durable materials such as metal or tile.
                <br /><br />
              </p>

              <h4>Important Note</h4>
              <p>
                As with any contract, always read the fine print before you sign. Be aware that
                warranties typically do not cover anything considered beyond “normal wear and tear.”
                <br /><br />
                For example, if a tree falls on your roof during a hurricane, that is neither the
                manufacturer’s nor the roofer’s fault. Ideally this sort of event would be covered
                by your insurance company.

                  A roof replacement is a major investment—but that doesn’t mean your new roof is “set
                  it and forget it.” Regular maintenance is the key to protecting your roof’s longevity
                  and your home’s safety. Even the highest quality roofing materials need routine care
                  to withstand Florida’s heat, storms, and humidity. Without regular checkups, small
                  issues like clogged gutters or cracked flashing can quickly snowball into expensive
                  repairs or premature failure.

                At SonShine Roofing, we’ve seen it all—shingles lifted by summer storms, debris buildup
                that traps moisture, and flashing that’s been slowly leaking for months. The good news?
                These are all preventable with the right maintenance plan. We recommend annual inspections
                and seasonal touch-ups to keep your roof performing like it should.
                <br /><br />
                Proper maintenance not only extends the life of your roof but also preserves your warranty,
                safeguards your home’s structure, and helps you avoid the stress of emergency repairs. Whether
                your roof is brand new or pushing its limits, we’re here to help you stay ahead of the
                curve—because since 1987, we’ve got you covered.
