Content Workflow
================

Where content lives
- WordPress (via WPGraphQL): blog posts, projects, glossary, faqs, persons, videos.
- Next.js app pages: service pages, about, contact, policy pages.

Publishing in WP
- Ensure posts/projects are Published, not Draft.
- Fill excerpts where available (used as SEO fallbacks).
- Provide featured images for richer OG cards.

Glossary linking
- Term pages auto-link other terms in the content body (first occurrence per term).
- Avoid keyword stuffing; links are budgeted to prevent overlinking.

Images
- For brand images, prefer Next.js `Image` component where possible.
- Default OG image: `/og-default.png` (1200Ã—630).

Noindex Policy
- Utility pages (`/reviews`, `/tell-us-why`) are marked noindex.
- Person and glossary terms are noindex by business choice.
