Some people might look at this truck and say, "That's a lot of money for a pickup."

And they'd be right.

But when you compare it to other high-performance trucks on the market Ram TRX, Raptor R, or a Ford Super Snake. None of them come close to what this truck actually does in the real world. Those trucks make impressive brochure horsepower, but this one puts down around 800 horsepower at the wheels.

Yes, there are single-cab 5.0 F-150s out there making wild numbers with twin turbos. They're impressive builds but let's be honest: most of them aren't daily-drivable. This truck is different. It's built to be daily driven, not trailered. And on top of that it's a Danali package. Which none of the other truck come close to from the factory.

Let's talk about the sound of the exhaust, the supercharger whine, the way the truck shakes at idle, and the violence when you drop it into 4-wheel drive and hit the gas, and you get something that factory built, or stripped-down race truck can't provide.

| **Truck** | **Drivetrain** | **Wheel Horsepower (Real)** | **Crank Horsepower** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your GMC 6.2L (ProCharged)\* | 4WD | ~800 whp | ~1,025 - 1,070 hp (est.) |
| Ram TRX\* | 4WD | ~580 - 590 whp | 702 hp |
| Ford Raptor R\* | 4WD | ~570 - 590 whp | 700 - 720 hp |
| Shelby F-150 Super Snake\* | 4WD | ~650 - 700 whp | ~770 - 785 hp |
|     |     |     |     |

This truck delivers true supertruck performance - real 800-wheel horsepower, 4WD traction, and the ability to be driven every day. That combination simply doesn't exist in most builds at this power level. So yes, at first glance it may seem like a lot of money for a pickup. But when you look at what it does, how it drives, and what it replaces, the value is undeniable. You can spend more money on a factory truck with less power and a bigger name, or just be average. The choice is yours.
